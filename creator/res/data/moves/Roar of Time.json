  "Description": "You unleash a roar that has the power to distort time. All creatures within 40 feet of you must make a WIS save against your Move DC, taking dragon damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. For any creature that failed the save by 5 or more, you may immediately take another action against them. Roar of Time may not be used as one of the additional actions. This move drains you of energy, and you may not make any attack until after the end of your next turn.",
