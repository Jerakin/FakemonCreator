### Download
Find the release for your OS under [latest releases](https://github.com/Jerakin/FakemonCreator/releases/latest).
`Fakemon.Creator.exe` is for Windows
`Fakemon.Creator.OSX.zip` is for mac, unzip it first.

You might have to trust it before your OS want's to run it.

### Use
As there is a lot of fields to fill I recommend that you start with a similar Pokémon or Move. You do this by going 
`File -> Open Pokemon` or `File -> Open Move`, this will list all the currently available Pokémon/Moves.

To make your custom moves and Fakemons be available for other Fakemons you have created you need first to save the package.

### Publishing the Package
1. Make sure everything in your package that it needs to be really is there.
2. Then send the `*.fkmn` file to [pokedex5e@gmail.com](mailto:pokedex5e@gmail.com) as an attachment. The subject should be "_Pokemon Package_".
3. Wait for it to be approved¹

¹ I will have to check the content and make sure if follows Apple and Google's rules for user content (sorry no vulgar language or images),
it will then be added to the [Fakemon Packages](https://github.com/Jerakin/FakemonPackages) which should make it available in the app.
