  "Description": "When targeted by or forced to make a saving throw from a single-target move, you may use your reaction to copy the creature's move against it, after activation but before the effects. If the move requires an attack roll, you have disadvantage on the attack. If the move requires a saving throw, the target has advantage on the roll. If the move causes damage, double the damage dice. The damage/effect tier for the move is based off of your level, not the target's.",
